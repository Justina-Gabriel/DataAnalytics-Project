SQL Capstone Solutions

Overview
This repo contains my solutions for a SQL capstone project analyzing customer savings, investments, and transactions.

Files
- `Project_Q1.sql` – Query customers with both savings & investment plans  
- `Project_Q2.sql` – Analyze transaction frequency by customer  
- `Project_Q3.sql` – Identify plans inactive for over a year  
- `Project_Q4.sql` – Calculate customer lifetime value (CLV)

How to Run
1. Load your database schema into your SQL engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
2. Open each `.sql` file in your SQL client and execute.  
3. Verify the results match the expected output in the project brief (SQL Capstone Project)
